# Chillar Client

## Getting Started

### 1. Build the App

Use [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) to build your project:

```sh
eas build
```

### 2. Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the Expo development server:

```sh
npx expo start
```

This will launch the Metro bundler and provide you with a QR code to open the app on your device or emulator.

### 3. Configure the Backend Link
Create a config.tsx file
Make sure to add your backend API link in the `config.tsx` file. Update relevant variable BACKEND_URL with your backend endpoint to enable communication between the client and server.
